                <dd>One way to distinguish between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at the end of the scales. The sharp <em>Pinus jeffrey</em> cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm of one's hand when rubbed down the cone. <em>Pinus ponderosa</em> cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm of one's hands. The memory device of 'gentle Jeffrey' and 'prickly ponderosa' can be used to differentiate between the species. Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of <em>Pinus jeffreyi</em> are glaucous, less bright green than those of <em>Pinus ponderosa,</em> and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs. <em>Pinus jeffreyi</em> can be somewhat distinguished from Pinus ponderosa by the relatively smaller scales of reddish-brown bark as compared to the larger plates of orangish ponderosa bark.<br><br>

                    The scent of <em>Pinus jeffreyi</em> is variously described as reminiscent of vanilla, lemon, pineapple, violets, apple, and, quite commonly, butterscotch. This scent may be sampled by breaking off a shoot or some needles, or by simply smelling the resin's scent in between the plates of the bark. This scent is related to the very unusual composition of the resin, with the volatile component made up almost entirely of pure n-heptane. It is because of this peculiarity that the trees are sometimes known as gasoline trees.</dd>
