                <dd><p>These frogs inhabit mountain bodies of water such as streams, lakes, wetlands, and flooded meadows from 4,500 feet to 12,000 feet elevation. They spend most of their lives in or around these water sources as they provide essential food sources and raising ground for tadpoles. The frogs inhabit both the East and Western Sierras down to areas North of Lake Tahoe. Although their range has not changed, the population density of the species has declined over the years due to their endangered status as well as other threats to their habitat.</p><p>

                    Adults can be found sitting on large rocks of the shoreline. Where there is little vegetation, larvae are distributed in warm shallow areas of water during daytime.</p>

                    Breeding sites include ponds, lakes, and streams that do not dry out, are deep enough to prevent freezing, and are without fish.[iNaturalist]</p>
