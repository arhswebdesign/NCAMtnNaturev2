                <dd>Foothill yellow-legged frogs occur in the Coast Ranges from the Santiam River in Marion County, Oregon south to the San Gabriel River in Los Angeles County and along the west slopes of the Sierra/Cascade mountain ranges in most of central and northern California. Other isolated populations have been reported in the Baja California Norte, in southern California, and at Sutter Buttes in Butte County, California. The species is found at elevations ranging from sea level to 6,700 feet (2,000 m) in Baja California Norte. In California, foothill yellow-legged frog have been recorded in the Sierra as high as 6,000 feet (1,800 m) near McKesick Peak, Plumas National Forest and 6,365 feet (1,940 m) at Snow Mountain at the boundary of Lake and Colusa Counties. They are found in flowing streams and rivers with either rocky substrate or sunny banks.[iNaturalist]
