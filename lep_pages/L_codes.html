        <dt>Choice of species</dt>
            <dd>I have limited my selection to those wildflower, butterfly and herp species that have the most observations in iNaturalist, and are found during June, July or August in the Sierra Nevada Range</dd>
        <dt>Species names</dt>
            <dd>Although perhaps surprising, there has been a lot of taxonomic revision lately, resulting in name changes. I have tried to go with the most correct names, even if these disagree with the field guides. iNaturalist is up-to-date in every case I know of.</dd>
        <dt>Butterfly abundance codes</dt>
            <dd>R - rare<br>
            U - uncommon<br>
            C - common<br>
            A - abundant<br>
            </dd>
        <dt>Ordering of wildflower species</dt>
            <dd>Most of this info is from "Sierra Nevada Wildflowers,
      by Karen Wiese; plants are shown in the order she chose, which is based on flower color.
            </dd>
        <dt>Ordering of butterfly species</dt>
            <dd>The order is based on Glassberg, J. "Butterflies Through Binoculars, the West," which, in turn is based on the order found in the NABA's "Checklist and English names of North American Butterflies"</dd>
        <dt>Butterfly habitat and host plants</dt>
            <dd>Most of the info comes from "Butterflies of the Pacific Northwest," by Robert Michael Pyle and Caitlyn C. LaBar</dd>
